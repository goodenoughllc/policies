We love to build software that we want to exist and we hope you'll love using the things we made. That being said, when you use the software we made you are bound to certain rules and agreements enumarated in these pages.

Legal policies and documenation are boring, but they are imporant and we have tried to keep them as clear, fair, and readable as possible.
