We aim to build the kind of software that we want to exist in the world — software that is a joy to use, fairly priced, and (most importantly) respectful of your data and privacy.

We’ve tried to take a similar approach with the terms and conditions that you are bound to when you use and interact with our products. These policies help us comply with laws from different countries and jurisdictions around the globe, but are (hopefully) written as clearly and fairly as we can make them.

We welcome your [feedback and questions]({{site.email_support}}) with regards to these policies, or just in general.
